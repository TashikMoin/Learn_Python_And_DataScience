Mutable -> Those objects that can be modified are called mutable objects.
	Examples --> lists, sets, dictionaries.
	
Immutable -> Those objects that can not be modified are called immutable objects.
	Examples --> bool,int,float,strings,tuples and frozenset
	
	str = "Tashik"
	str[2] = 'z' // not allowed because strings are immutable.
	but,
	str = "Ali" // this is allowed because we are not modifying the existing object 
		       but changing the tag of the pointer object.
